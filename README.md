# Data-Science-MLS-Project
My final Data Science project for my graduate certificate in Data Science. The project is on exploring player data from MLS player metrics. We use the relevant features in developing a model that can assist a team in predicting the outcome of a game given certain player metrics conditions and test the models validity. We also develop an visual application with ShinyApp so that a team can continue to draw insights from the data at the conclusion of this project.
